# VolumeList-Cpp [WORK IN PROGRESS | 1%]


This project allows to add a notion of volume in contiguous containers in memory. 

An interesting example of use would be a timetable application.

The project is under development, it is not yet usable (but it will be soon)

TODO:

-Add fonctional CI

-Add API functions and implementation
